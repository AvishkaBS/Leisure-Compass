## Overview

The internet offers a vast array of digital content, including movies, music, books, and more. While streaming services and social media provide easy access to this content, finding material that aligns with personal interests can be challenging. Traditional recommendation systems often fall short, focusing solely on genres or emotional states. This study introduces a new approach that enhances recommendations by considering both the user's mood and personality. The system, built as a web application with Flask and hosted on an EC2 instance, provides personalized content suggestions. It also features a database to store personality data, reducing the need for repeated questionnaires, and includes user-friendly interfaces to improve the overall experience.
